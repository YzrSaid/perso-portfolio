        Hi!👋🏻 I am Aldrin, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at Western Mindanao State University, with a strong interest in mobile application development and UI/UX design.

        I enjoy building applications from concept to execution, especially in mobile development where I often handle the entire process, from interface design to functionality. For web projects, I focus on front-end development, creating clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experiences.
